# Autonomous-AI-Racecar

## Chassis and car ##

The final result, when completed will look somewhat similar to the image of the racecar included below. There will be changes to the basic build based on my custom build.

## First iteration chassis build ##

This was the first attempt at building the RC car chassis.

After the car was completely assembled, during the RC car testing, I discovered that the main drivetrain shaft was locking up. I spent the last couple of weeks dismantling the differential gearbox and the gear assembly, but the problem seems to remain every time I re-assemble the entire drivetrain and geartrain. The wheels still seem to be locked up.

## Second iteration chassis build ##

Fortunately, I had another kit lying around as a backup and the new kit is finally assembled and tested. See the pictures below for the progression of the build.

### First RC electronics test and checkout - kill switch, motor, ESC, receiver, steering servo and battery hookup ###

### All electronics assembled on the chassis ###
### Note: As can be seen, there was a steering offset. I tried tweaking the steering trim on the Futaba remote, but the offset was too much to be corrected by the trim settings, so I took apart the steering servo and took apart the steering horn assembly. ###
###       After this I wired everything back up again and found the 90-degree neutral position and reassembled the horn carefully again. After this there was minimal steering bias in neutral. ###

### First test drive ###
### Note: The car seems to drive without any issues as on the previous set. However it was still veering a little to the side because of the steering servo bias in netral straight heading. ###

### Note: To compensate for the veering, I adjusted and tested the steering trims for the left and right steering which led to driving in almost a straight line. The battery dies before I could record a run, so I will update the next video when I do the next test runs. ###
